# Sudoku Game in Python with PyQT
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that requires players to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. I have developed a Sudoku game program using Python and PyQT, a powerful GUI toolkit for Python.

## Features of the Sudoku Game Program

This Sudoku game allows players to choose the difficulty level and provides them with a random puzzle that is automatically generated using an algorithm. The program has a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for players to navigate and interact with the game.

To ensure that the player inputs are valid, the program has a built-in validator that checks for duplicates in rows, columns, and sub-grids. The game also features a timer, so that players can see how long they took to complete the task.

The game program is designed to be challenging, yet enjoyable. It stimulates the player's mind and encourages them to think strategically in order to solve the puzzle. It also provides a sense of achievement when the player successfully completes a puzzle.

In addition to the gameplay mode, my Sudoku game program also includes a computer solving mode. This feature allows players to input a puzzle and have the program solve it automatically. This solving mode is particularly useful for players who may be stuck on a particular puzzle or who want to check their solution against the program's. The program uses an algorithmic approach to solve the puzzle and provides step-by-step guidance on how it arrived at the solution.
